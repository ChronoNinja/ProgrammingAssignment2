Assignment 2 Markdown File
========================================================

In my opinion, this assignments tests a multitude of developing skills:

1. The use of git and github as a means of code development and code sharing amongst peers
2. The continued development of R Programming skills
   + Lexical scoping of variables
   + Using multiple environments to hold variable values
   
The videos and powerpoint slides were not necessarily as helpful in completing this assignment (aside from understanding the Lexical scoping of R).  Instead, I had to research the documentation such as ?"<<-" to help understand the material.

Per the assignment instructions, further details of the code are included as comments within the code instead of including in this markdown file.
